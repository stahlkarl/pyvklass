# pyvklass
pyvklass is a python module that simplifies interaction with vklass.se. It's a work in progress and won't do all the things we want it to at the moment, but we'll get there. Our goal is to automatize many of the everyday tasks on vklass aswell as building an acceptable vklass client both as TUI and webpage.

## COMMANDS
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
